This project aims to reimplement and hopefully improve upon the structures and methods used in the paper "High Qualit Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning".
For training the NYU Depth v2 dataset will be used and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/nyu-depth-v2.

A validation set has been made by taking from training data.

Note that the depth maps in the test set are 16-bit while the ones in train are 8-bit.
